Security groups - myip
===================================

Replaces rules in a security group with my current public IP address
Why? Non-static IP at home; easy updating from laptop on GSM / free WiFi

TODO:
-------
* Test if IPv6 work
* Check if rules already exist - only add if required
* Handle rules from 0.0.0.0
* Adding then removing seems a bit of a roundabout method to do this
